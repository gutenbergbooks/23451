<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy called Little Yellow Wang-lo.
He lived with his father in a boat which was moored in a river near a
town<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">. </ins></p>

<p>His name was Fo-Pa (little Yellow Wang-lo always called him Pa). He
was a duck merchant and had hundreds of ducks&mdash;white ducks, black
ducks, brown ducks, big ducks, little baby ducks, and middle-sized
ducks&mdash;ducks that said quack, drakes that said quork, and ducklings
that said queek.</p>

<p>Little Yellow Wang-lo had to get up very early every morning to call
the ducks close round the houseboat, and then he used to feed them; when
they had eaten their breakfasts they all swam away down the river to
look for little fishes, frogs and other things, and only came back at
night when it was time to have supper and to go to bed.</p>

<p>One hot day Fo-Pa, who was a very fat little man, called little

<p>Little Yellow Wang-lo’s eyes shone with excitement at the idea of

<p>So then he went to another corner where the pigs were sold, and after

<p>But the little pig had a will of his own, and would not go the way
